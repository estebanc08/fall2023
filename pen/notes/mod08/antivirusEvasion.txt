Antivirus Techniques
    * AV programs try to identify malware
    * Techniques vary, Lenny zeltser identifies with these approaches
        - Signature detection
        - Heuristic detection ( attributes of the file as a whole such as entropy)
        - Behavioral detection (run the program and see what it does and see if its suspicious)

Negative outcome to pen testers
    * Scenario:
        - Generate meterpreter executable
        - Give it to a host via remote mount
        - Execute
        - FAIL

Changing AV Landscape
    - in 2008, meterpreter.exe was recognized by 3 of 32 antivirus products
    - Use of encoders would help
    - Some encoders had 100% avoidance (Shikata ga nai)

Finding the signature
    * Typically, only a few bytes in a file compromise the signture that most AV products will identify
    * You can use the wolf-fence method made popular for debugging to identify the offending code or data

AV bypass methods
    * Encoders
        - MSF encoders, msfvenom, packers (UPX, etc)
    * Ghost writers
        - command substitution, custom metasploit stagers
    * Payload scripts with interpreters

You only need to defeat your clients AV
    * Ask client what AV they use
    * Install it on your system

If you still want to encode
    * Use of default exe template will likely fail. There are a few others that may evade AV
    * Multiple encodings rarely help
    * Purchase a code signing certificate (reduces rejection rate by a fctor of 4) according to a 2012 study 

Ghost writing tools are also available
    * Hyperion
    * Shellter
    * Backdoor Factory
    * Astrobaby generator
    * Metasm

Using payload scripts
    * pyinjector
    * Veil
