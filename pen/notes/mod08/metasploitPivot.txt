ARP scanning in meterpreter session
    * If you have started a meterpreter session on a compromised host, you may be able to find other possible victims
        - ipconfig (windows)
        - shell (then ipconfig or ip -a on unix)
        - run arp_scanner [-r ip-range] (in some meterpreter versions)

Metaspolit session control
    * Meterpreter sessions can be run detatched with the command 
        - background
    * You can see available sessions with the command
        - sessions
    * Sessions are numbered and you can bring a sessions back to the foreground with sessions -i session#

Routing through a meterpreter session
    * You can identify the process the meterpreter has exploiter by using the following commands
        - ps
        - getpid
    * If the currently exploited process is likely to terminate, you can attack to a more long-lived process with the command
        - migrate pid
    * You can, however, only migrate to a process that you have write access to
    * One can add a route to a network through a backgrounded meterpreter session on a compromised host within the network by using the command
        -route add ip-address netmask session#
    * Imagine session 2 is a background meterpter session to the compromsised host 172.32.138.4 and we want to route to hosts on network 72.32.138.0 through that host
        - route add 72.32.138.0 255.255.255.0 2
    * See current routes with
        - route print

Metasploit port scanning
    * scanner/portscan/tcp

Meterpreter Port Forwarding
    * portfwd add -l local-port# -p remote-port# -r remote-host-ip
    * Allows you to automatically connect connections to a port on one machine to a port on another machine
