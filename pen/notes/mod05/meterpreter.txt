Using the meterpreter
    Metasplot Module Rank
        Each metasploit module has a rank
            * Excellent (will never crash the service)
            * great (has default target and will auto-detect or use application specific return address)
            * good (has a default target which is the common case)
            * normal (reliable but depends upon a specific version)
            * average (unreliable or difficult to exploit)
            * low (nearly impossible to exploit)
            * manual (unstable or difficult to exploit or of no use unless configured by the user)
        Ranking are assigned by the module author (use as upper bound)

    What payload should I use given an exploit
        Many payloads are available, but use meterpreter for:
            stealth
            reliable
            flexible
        Meterpreter ( Meta interpreter) is a payload that has the following properties
            * Provides a command interpreter that runs as the user who was executing the exploited process
            * Must useful command: help
            * Supports listing of remote systems files, file uploaded and downloaded, remote shell execution and many other functions
    
    How does the meterpreter work
        * uses a stager to download code and inject into a DLL
        * payload is small, but meterpreter is large
        * in windows, uses DLL injection. Written into the code section of executing library and no file is created
        * TLS/1.0 (transport layer security) is used to encrypt communications

    Communications security
        * Meterpreter uses TLS for obfuscation, not security
        * TLS/1.0 is insecure, susceptible to padding oracle attack
        * Wes McGrew (Horne Cyber) presented DEFCON talk about lack of security in pen testing education materials and tools. Demonstrated ability to hijak meterpreter session
        * supports the creation of payloads using paranoid mode that can avoid this problem

    Meterpreter versions
        * Which version to use?
        * grep meterpreter show payloads
