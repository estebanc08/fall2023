What is SSRF
    * Server side request forgery is an attack in which one causes a server to generate and satisfy an unintended HTTP request
    * Web servers must parse URLs, headers, and body requests
    * Modern software development depends on the use of library code to solve subproblems
    * Different library functions may be used by different phases of processing a web request

what is a URL
    * foo://example.com:4444/path/info?param=value#whatup
    * Scheme
        We mostly care about http and https
    * Authority example.com:4444
    * path /path/info
    * query ?param=value
    * fragment #whatup

Different Parsers get different results
    * Imagine you have code to accept urls of google.com, but reject all other urls and you see this
        * http://google.com#@evil.com/...
    * PHP parse_url interprets this is a google link
    * PHP readfile interprets this as an evil.com link

Using Unicode to exploit parsing
    * can inject Hex characters to change google.com/path/NN/password to google.com/path/../password
