Finding out about web servers using netcat
    * nc 192.168.1.191 80
        GET / HTTP/1.0
        GET /mutillidae/ HTTP/1.1
    * can get back responses

Browsers and Servers lie
    * API messages sent between browsers and server provide a wealth of information about the software that is running, properties of the endpoint, computers, and user information
    * All of these things can be false information
    * Servers may not be running the software they claim. Browser user agent strings can be forged. User information can be fake

Intercepting and modifying API messages
    * You can intercept messages in two ways
        - using a proxy
        - using a browser tool
    * Proxy is an appointed representative to act on your behalf
    * web proxy is a program specifically designed to forward API messages to web servers on behalf of your browser and then return the server responses

Why to be a proxy
    * Proxies can provide benefits
        - store commonly referenced pages
        - restrict web web usage
        - track web usage
    * The burp suite implements a web proxy that provides the ability to cappture, edit, replay, manipulate, and programmatically control the 
    interactions between web browser

Web connection without proxy
    * browser running on random port, Server running apache on port 80
    * Browser sends request to server, server sends response to browser
Web connection With proxy
    * browser sends request to possibly local proxy
    * Proxy relays request to server
    * Server responds to proxy
    * Proxy relays response to server

Proxy configuration
    * Set proxy parameters to specificy IP address and listening port
    * set browser preferences to use Proxys IP address

Browser Interception tools
    * Rather than separate proxy process, these tools modify an augment behavior of your browser to modify web API

Javascript validation bypass
    * Servers may try to enforce security by using javascript client-side code to validate input
    * This can be used oo filter special characters out of password fields
    * Because the server trusts the browser to do the right thing and the browser is under the users control thus inherently unreliable

SQL injection
    * Structured Query Language. Used in many web sites to provide a way to query databsaes
    * SQL injections is an attack in whcih user data is inserted into SQL query
