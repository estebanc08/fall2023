SSLStrip?
    * Sits between browser and https server
    * Converts and caches https links delivered to the browser and also converts and caches 302 location redirects
    * When an HTTPS link in the cache is followed, the page is requestyed from the secure server and delivered via HTTP to the browser

Requirements for best use?
    * Target a web app that has an HTTP landing page that then goes to an HTTP

Exploting broswer behavior and user expectations
    * Modern browsers provide:
        - Few and subtle indicators when the page being viewed is HTTPS
        - Significant user impediments when the secure page does not have certificate

Steps to use SSLstrip
    * Enable ip forwarding
    * Redirect HTTP traffic to sslstrip
        iptables -t nat -A prerouting -p tcp --destiniation-port 80 -j redirect --to-port Listenport
    * run sslstrip
    * arpsoof to get in the middle
    * ettercap to grap credentials

Possible Problems
    * Content encodings are hard to handle
    * Secure cookie will not be sent correctly
    * Page already cached will be rewritten

How/Why to use in Pen test
    * Allows misdirection without Phishing
    * Intercept secure logins to corportate/intranet servers
    * Be cautions because SSLStrip will strip all HTTPS communications,  even personal ones
