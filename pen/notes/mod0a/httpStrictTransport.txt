What problems does HSTS Address
    * Users may navigate to HTTP sresources accidentally and get MtiMd by attackers
    * Web applications reached by HTTPS links may contain HTTP link
    * MiTM attack may attempt to provide an invalid certificate for the user to accept

How does HSTS stop these
    * HTTP requests are auto redirected by the browser to identified HTTPS servers
    * HSTS redirects page-embedded HTTP links for identified domains to HTTPS links
    * HSTS prohibits user certificae override for idenfied domains

How does HSTS work
    * Web application must request that the browser use HSTS by providing Strict-Transport-Security header
    * If the browser supports HSTS, it stores a super cookie which cannot be removed through any browser-supported action.
    * Max lifetime of an HSTS cookie is 31,536,000 seconds
    * If the header lacks the includeSubDomains specification, attackers can spoof subdomains

Does anyone use HSTS?
    * about 12.5% websites use HSTS

Vulnerabilites
    * If you can catch the first connection by a client to an HSTS enabled-site, you can intercept the HSTS header and prevent super cookie regrestation
    * if the header neglets to include subdomains, you can spoof for example www.art.com to wwww.art.com

Tools
