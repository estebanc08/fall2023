What is ARP?
    * Address resolution protocol
    * Used to identify the correspondence between an IP address (layer 3) of a host and its associated MAC address (layer 2) to support delivery of IP packets in datalink layer

ARP messages
    * Request (broadcast)
        - whoever has this ip addr, tell me your MAC
    * Reply
        - This is my IP addr and here is my MAC
    * Reverse Request (RARP)
    * Reverse Response

ARP spoofing
    * When a host sees an ARP reply, it usually trusts that it is correct. No way to verify info is correct
    * You can lie (spoof ARP reply) in order to get info intended for a machine at a given IP
    * When you send a reply to a machine, it will generally trust id and this will poison its ARP cache (put bogus info in cache)

ARPSpoof
    * Need to put yourseld on the local network 
    * ip_forward
    * man in the middle, must have ip_forwarding enabled
    * arpsoof -i interface -t target -r host

Poisoning the cache
    * Message 1: Attacker tells gateway he is the target
    * Message 2: Attacker tells target he is the gateway 
    * MITM message from target to server 

Where will thiss not work?
    * Amazon EC2, Amazon VPC, Google Compute Engine, MS Azure
