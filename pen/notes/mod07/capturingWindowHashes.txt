What is SMB?
    - SMB usually refers to the windows server message block service
        * Supports file sharing with common internet file system CIFS network browsing, printing, service, and interprocess communication
        * TCP ports 137, 139, and 445 as well as UDP ports 137 and 138 are used to support SMB

Microsoft Authentication protocol History
    - LM (14 character password. No salt. Only authenticates cleint (weakly) to server. DES-based encryption
    - NTLM Challenge Response
    - NTLMv1: Server generated challenge
    - NTLMv2: Mutual authentication of server and client
    - Kerberos (Windows 2000): Requires NT hash for authentication

LMV1/NTLMV1 Challenge-Response
    - A rogue server can capture hashed passwords using static salt (1122334455667788) and use rainbow tables to get password

NTLM Reflextive Attack
    - This uses the client itself as a server, letting it provide server responses. MS08-068 Patch: SMb refuses to answer a challenge that is has just issued

NTLM Relay Attack
    - Exploited by Zack Attack
    - Can be avoided using extended protection of authentication (EPA) on a per-service basis

Kerberos (MIT)
    - Trusted third-party architecture. Ditch DTLM right?
    1) Client request TGT from KDC
    2) Authentication service sends encrypted TGT and session key
    3) Client requests server access from TGS
    4) TGS sends encrypted session key and ticket
    5) Client sends service ticket

NTLM still required
    - For the following situations:
        * Client authenticates to server using IP address
        * Client authenticates to server belonging to different active directory forest using legacy NTLM trust instead of transitive inter-forest trust
    - Blocked events are logged with windows
    - Can enforce NTLMv2 in local security policy if you can
