Private IP
    We can distinguish between 3 kinda of internet connected hosts within a network
        1 - Hosts that only need access to locally connected resources as a client and provide no services
        2 - Host that need access to a small range of outside services as a client and provide few or no services
        3 - Hosts that need unfettered access to outside services and provide services to other internet hosts
        There are MANY hosts in cat 1 and 2

    RFC 1918 - Address allocation for private internets
    The following address ranges are provided for private networks
        - 10.0.0.0/8 (10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255) For example - Inside the University, you can use 10.x.x.x IP networks to provide content to students
        and staff while outside of the University, the school provides class B network to deliver content
        - 172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255) Often used for virtual machine hosting
        - 192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255) Routers for home use

Port Forwarding
    - Allows a router with a public IP address to forward communications to a a NATed machines private IP address
    - This allows machines on the wide area network (internet) side of your router to communicate inside your network (usually bad idea)
    - Some applications (video games) require you to provide access to a service running on your maching. For gaming, this enables direct communication between
    multiple players without burdening the game server

    What does it require?
        Need to identify:
            Destination IP adddress (that is the port that other clients will specify as the IP destination for their packets). usually your routers WAN address
            Destination port number of the forwarding device
            Target IP address (usually a local IP address) where the packets will finally end up
            port number of the target machine
            A service needs to be running to actually achieve communication
