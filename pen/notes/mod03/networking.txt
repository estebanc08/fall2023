    Data Link
    Physical
Service Data units from upper layers are encapsulated in protocol data units as messages go layer from layer
Pen testers tend to deal with all layers from physical wire taps to higher level application layer exploits

IPV4
    IPV4 packets are 32 bits
    Are not guaranteed to arrive in correct sequence
    Time to Live (TTL) decrements upon forwarding to guarantee packets dont travel forever. When TTL is 0, packet stops forwarding. TTL is 8 bits

ICMP Network Layer Packet Structure 
    Internet Control Message Protocol packets embedded in IP with protocol = 1 
    These messages can be used for control or diagnostic purposes or can be generated in response to errors with IP operations

UDP and TCP: What are they
    User Datagram Protocol is a communication protocol that provides communication of datagrams or packets of octets
    Transmission Control Protocol is a communication protocol that provides reliable ordered streams of octets between programs

UDP vs TCP
    TCP has ordered sequences of packets. Need order to be maintained such as file transfer
    UDP is useful for real-time communications where speed of transmission is more important than order of receipt (Youtube Streaming or gaming)
