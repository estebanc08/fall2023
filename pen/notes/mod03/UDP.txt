UDP Packet Structure

    Source port number and destination port number are both 16 bits
    Length(UDP header + data) is 16 bits
    UDP checksum is 16 bits
    Application Data (message)

Like TCP packets, UDP packets have soruce and destination port numbers
UDP is used for most DNS queries--ones that require no more than 512 bytes of data (even though UDP can hold more than 65507 data bytes)

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
    Packet Payload Structure
        Type of Message     8 bits
        Code(subtype of message)   8 bits
        Checksum (of header + data excluding checksum) 16 bits
        Quench - rest of packet
        Data(optional)
    Sometimes used for covert communications
    Common ICMP Packet Types
        0 - Echo reply (response to a ping)
        3 - destination unreachable
        5 - redirect (use another route to your destination)
        8 - echo request (ping)
        11 - time to live exceeded

Traceroute: What is it really?
    Tries to find all hosts on the network between your local host and some destination host
    Does this by sending packets with TTLs increasing from 1 up to 30
    For each different TTL, 3 packets are sent
    As each packet expires, it should receive an ICMP time exceeded reply from the host at which it arrived
    Traceroute waits 5 seconds for each expiration
    if 5 sec is exceeded, an * is printed
    Otherwise, if a host responds with a TTL exceeded message, then traceroute prints the TTL value, host IP address, and round-trip time of each probe

Wireshark
    Wireshark is a packet sniffing and analysis tool
    Can start by selecting an interface on which to sniff. You must be root or a member of a privileged group to do raw packet captures
    It will show the packets that it caputes on that interface
