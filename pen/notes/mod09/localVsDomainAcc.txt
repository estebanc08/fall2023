Local vs Domain Account
    - Domain user accounts are registered with an active directory server for a network of machiens
        * Authorized credentials, access rights, and privileges are associated with that account within the entire domain
        * Users in the Domain Admin group have admin rights over every machine in the domain
    - Local user accounts are recorded in the SAM database on a local machine and the acc4ess rights and privileges of the account extend only to local machine
        * Local account will not support kerberos

Network Shares
    - Filesystems, printers, interprocess communications
    - net share to see what can be shared remotely
    - net view

User Account Control
    - Maintains process integrity levels (high medium low) that determine a processes rights
    - Notififications

Integrity Levels
    - High: Server Generated challenge
    - Medium: Mutual authentication of server and client
    - Low: Requires NT hash for auth

UAC bypass
    - Given:
        * admin process at med integrity
        * Default UAC notification settings. Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer
        * bypass_injection (Metasplot module that employs admin session to spawn payload)
        * use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
        * set session ..
        * set payload ..

Local Admins are still powerfull
