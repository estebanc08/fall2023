What about local admins
    - When new machines are deployed, its easier to maintain them if you can gain local admin access easily and reliably
    - As time goes on, you want to make sure you can maintain local admin access over thesea machines as well
    - AD made it easy to distribute this local admin control by creating a local user account
    - groups.xml

Microsoft Issued a Patch
    - Patch makes itn impossible to place passwords in a group policy 

What does LAPS do
    - checks whether the password of the local admin account has expired
    - Generates a new password when the old password is either expired or required to be chainged prior to expiration
    - Validates the new password against the password policy
    - Reports the password to active directory, storing it with a confidential attribute with the computer account in active dir
    - Reports the next expiration time for the password to active directory, storing it with an attribute with the computer account in active directory
    - Changes admin account password
    - Can be read from active directory (AD) by allowed users
