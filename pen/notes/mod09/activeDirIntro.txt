Organizational Units (OUS)
    - OUs are AD containers that hold objects of various kinds
        * Security Principles are associated with SIDs and can be user accounts, groups, or computer accounts
        * No other objects in an OU are security principals

Security Principles
    - Security Principles can be
        * assigned permissions to access resources
        * given user rights
        * audited by tracking their actions

OU structureal overview
    - OUs contain
        * Users
        * Groups
        * computers
        * Shared Folder Objects
        * Contacts
        * Printers
        * InetOrgPerson objects
        * Other OUs
        * Can support multiple hierarchical layers
        * Support inheritances of OU settings in child OUs

OU Logical Groupings
    - Group resources Hierarchically
        * We use the term resource in all senses of the word to include both people and things
        * Hierarchical groupings correspond to business structure are commonly employed
        * Sales:
            - Us
            - International
        * Marketing
        * Engineering
            - Development
            - IT
            - Testing

Inheritance and OUS
    - OUs are the smallest domain unit to which admin permissions and group policies can be assigned
    - Examples:
        * One sysadmin role for IT computing resources and another for development
        * One individual responsible for all users and group security permissions
    - Principle of Least Privilege should be employed:
        * Users should have minimum permissions unless otherwise specified

How do groups work
    - Groups have a type:
        * Security Group
            Have associated rights and permissions and can receive email
        * Distributions Group
            Used for email only
    - Groups should have a scope
        * Domain Local
            Remain in the domain in which created can grant permissions in that single domain
        * Global
            Can contain other groups from in which created. Can give permissions in any domain in the forest
        * Universal
            Can include groups and accounts from any domain in the domain tree or forest. Can include permissions in any domain as well
 
 Group Policies
    - Group policies can be assigned at the site, domain, and OU level
    - They can be applied to user accounts and computer accounts
    - Sample policies:
        * Restrict users from installing new programs 
        * Disallow use of control panel
        * Limit choices for display and desktop settings
        * gpedit.msc

ACLS and ACES
    - Each object in AD has an Access Control List (ACL)
    - This is a list of user accounts and groups that are allowed to access the resource
    - For each ACL, there is an access control entry (ACE) defining what those users can do with the resource
    - Deny permissions are always listed first. Access is denied to a denied user even if a later allow permissioon allows them access

Using Group Policy for Security
    - password policies, lockout paramters
    - can create group policy object and link to OU
    - samples:
        * Enforce password history
        * Lockout Duration
        * Min psswd length
        * Reset account timer
        * Accounts: Rename admin account
        * Domain Controller: Allow server operators to schedule tasks
        * Interactive Logon: Do no display last user naem
        * Shutdown
