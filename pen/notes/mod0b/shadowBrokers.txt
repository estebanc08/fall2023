What is TAO
    * unlike programs revealed by edward snowden, such as xKeyScore, that are aimed at mass surveillance, the tailored access operations groups
    at fort meade engages in directed operations to breach the security of communications by specific individuals
    * Some of the methods employed by TAO are software exploits

Shadow Brokers
    * The Shadow Brokers (TSB) surfaced on 13 august 2016 with an auction of exploit tools developed by the equation group
        The equation group is presumably an NSA team name kaspersky
    * That leak includes the extrabacon CISCO 0-Day exploit, an authentication bypass exploit that provides control to anyone who knows the SNMP community string
    * TSB released 5 groups of exploits altogether. Their final leak considered to be the most damaging, included the Fuzzbunch exploitation framework and the ExternalBlue windows exploit
    * Release 5 (Lost in Translation) occured on saturday 14 april 2017, to the great distress of numerous system admins looking forward to either a relaxing weekend or spending time filing their taxes

EternalBlue Patch Timing
    * Some time before march of 2017, the NSA warned Microsoft that a probable leak of exploit tools had occured
    * On march 14 2017, Microsoft released a patch for MS17-010 (EternalBlue) as a result of NSAs communication
    * Microsoft even released an emergency patch for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 even though those systems were well beyond EOL

Patching Fails
    * On Friday, 12 May 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack began. This attack used the EternalBLue exploit and DoublePulsar downloader to achieve its goal
    * This attack was unwittingly stopped by Marcus Hutchins who registered a domain referenced in the software, 
    only to find that registering it enabled a kill switch that would caseu the malware to stop
    * August of 2017, after attending DEFCON 25 and being hailed as a minor hero, marcus was arrested on six federal hacking related charges 

How does EternalBlue work
    * EternalBlue exploits a buffer overflow opportunity in large non-paged kernel pool memory
    * EternalBlues method is much more complex than the kind of stack smashing attack that AlephOne described

Execution chain of events
    1) service is called resulting in overflow of groom packets internal metadata
    2) the memory descriptor list (MDL) of the overwritten grooms packet struct results in arbitrary write-what-where primitive on the next data transmitted
    3) MDL used to disable data execution prevention (DEP) on a fixed static region of the HAL heap whose page table entry is also fixed
    4) second malicious used to overflwo another buffer
    5) MDL used to place shellcode in a newly executable region
    6) address for the SRVNET struct is in overwritten and conatins handler function pointer which is the address of the shellcode
    7) corrupted groom packet
