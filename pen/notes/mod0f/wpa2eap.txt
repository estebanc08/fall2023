EAP
    * Extensible Authentication Protocol
    * EAP is a framework for authentication with a variety of implementation types
    * TLS:
        - original 2008 EAP standard. Still secture if warnings about false credentials are heeded
    * PEAP:
        - encapsulates EAP in a TLS tunnel
    * TTLS:
        - Server authentication by its CA signed PKI
    * EAP/FAST
        * Assign Protocol Access Credential (PAC) to each user. Difficult to do without running in insecure mode

Radius
    * Remote Authentication Dial in User Service
    * Authentication, Authorization, Accounting
    * Authentication:
        - Historically used locally stored flat file, modern servers use external services (Kerberos, LDAP, AD)
    * Authorization:
        - 3 responses (reject, challenge, accept)
        - other attributes (stored or connection parameters)
    * Accounting:
        - Accounting start, interim update, and accounting stop

Attacking EAP:
    * Assumptions:
        - Network SSID is easily spoofed, thus unreliable
        - TLS gives us a way to validate the access point
    * Actual Practice:
        - Some deployments of EAP will disable validation and trust any Access point
        - Attacker sets up a fake AP mirroring the actual SSID
    * It gets better
        - Some wireless clients will attempt multiple EAP types during authentication

Securing Wireless Networks
    * Do not use TKIP or WEP
    * Use WPA/EAP, PEAP, TTLS, or TLS for authentication
    * Have clients check the AP certificate
    * Avoid using pre-shared keys, if you must, then use password over 16 characters
    * Do not use hidden access points
    * Disable insecure EAP types 
    * Firewall the wireless network from your internal network

Wireless IDs approaches
    * Detect
        - deauth attacks
        - DoS attacks
        - Rogue Access Points
    * IDS = detection, not prevention

SHEWHART/DEMING Cycle
    * Plan-Do-Check-Act
    * Assessments must be performed on a regular basis
    * Third-Party is helpful
