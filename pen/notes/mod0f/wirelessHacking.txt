Wireless
    * IEEE 802.11 family of standards defines how wireless LANs are implemented
    * 802.11 b/g work in the range of 2.4-2.483 GHz
    * This bandwidth range is broken up into 14 overlapping channels
    * US channels 1-11 are supported and above 11 is prohibited in the US

SSID
    * Service Set Identifier (network name)
    * BSSID (Basic SSID): Mac address of the access point
    * ESSID (Extended SSID) name for one or more APs providing the same service (UF Guest)

802.11 Handshake
    * Probe request to Access Point (AP) ----->
    * Probe response to station <------
    * Auth request ---->
    * Auth challenge <-----
    * Auth response ---->
    * Auth success   <-----
    * Associate Request ---->
    * Associate Response <-----
    * Data <------->

Wireless encryption 
    * Open: no encryption can be seen in things like coffee shops
    * WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
        - Uses RC4 stream cipher and CRC32 for integrity check
    * WPA (Wifi protocol Access)
        - Uses temporary key integrity protocol (TKIP)
        - Message integrity check subject to key reinstallation and spoofing

ARP and FMS attack
    * ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
        - Destination is always FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF and size is 86 or 68 bytes

FMS WEB cracking deals
    * Each WEP packet is separately encrypted (rather than stream encrypted) because of the likelihood of single packet drop
    * WEP key is a string of 10 hex digits
    * IVs are transmitted in clear text
    * RC4 is a stream cipher so if a known message is sent many times with many different IVs the stream can be decrypted
    * WEP is cracked by sniffing an ARP packet, then replaying it over and over again to generate many encrypted replies with different IVs

How does WPA encryption
    * The access point and the client station share pairwise master key (PMK)
    * The AP and station use a four way handshake to establish a pairwise transient key (PTK) for a session encryption and group for a session encryption and group temporal key (GTK) for broadcast and multicast
    * First WPA implementation used TKP (Temporal key integrity protocol) which is based on RC4

WPA3
    * WPA3 was released in 2018 as a more secure alternative to WPA2
    * in 2020 became mandatory

How to use Kali for wireless hacking
    * You don't usually use the host wireless connection, though it is possible with some machines
    * Better to use a USB wireless Adaptor
