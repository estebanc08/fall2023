Remote Password Guessing vs Spraying
    - Bruteforcing random passwords might lead to account getting locked, might be better to use more targetted passwords if this is the case
    - Password like fall2021 when trying to hack a school account is better than random exhaustive search
    - Can 'spray' targetted passwords across a lot of accounts vs a lot of passwords on one account
    - Most Windows password guessing is done through SMB (TCP ports 139 and 445)
        * Often blocked by firewall
        * This is done via password guessing on remote share mounts
        * If 192.168.202.44 is our remote target w/ account admin

Password Guessing Countermeasures
    * Restrict tcp ports 135 (MSRPC), 139 and 445 (SMB), and 3389 (TS) at the firewall
    * Use host-resident firewall to restrict access
    * Disable unnessary services
    * Enforce the use of strong (long) passwords
    * Set an account lockout threshold and apply it to the admin account
    * Log account logon failures, and review the logs

LANMAN Passwords
    * Character Limit: 14
    * Passwords converted to uppercase
    * Passwords null-padded to 14 bytes anbd divided into two seven byte halves
    * Only 69 characters available for the password, so only 69^7 unique password halves

Why donâ€™t we just compute and store all possible password hashes? (RAINBOW TABLES)
    * Problem: computing and storing hashes takes a lot of space  (243 possible LM passwords).
    * The Rainbow Table Plan is based on a trick attributed originally to Martin Hellman.
    * It uses two functions, namely: H, the hash function, and R, the reduction function.
    * The reduction function translates a hash into a possible key to be hashed.

Rainbow Tables
    * Starting with a password, apply (H followed by R) some fixed number of times.
    * This yields a hash chain.
    * Store the ends and the beginnings of every hash chain.
    * Upon encountering a new hash, apply R (possibly followed by H and R repeatedly) until you find a word at the end of a chain.
    * Then start at the beginning of that chain until you encounter the hash you presented initially.
    * Failure modes exist (colliding chains, for example)
