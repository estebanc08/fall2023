Eternal Red 
    * Just as eternal blue is an SMB exploit for windows, eternal red is an SMB exploit for Linux
    * Sophos Naked Security website
    * plan is as follows:
        - find a writeable smb share being provided by a vulnerable version of samba
        - upload a .so (shared object) file
        - identify the local filename
        - send an IPC request to run that locally stored program
    * can get root user 

Keep your socks clean
    * One recent exploit that followed dirty cow was given the name dirty sock. Not a kernel vulernability
    * Dirty socks is associated with an injection vulnerability in the snap daemon
    * this daemon usually used to install software packages can do many other things including create new user
    * to achieve some of its outcomes, it checks the uid of the executing user and records this in an attribute string
    * checks for uid, it searches the attribute string for the uid property
    * one can inject an extra uid property into this string by manipulating a parameter which is not sanatized. Thus, one can get privilege escalation

Sudo
    * the problem occurs because of a vulnerability associated wth little-used configuration in the sudoers file /etc/sudoers
    * this sudoers file identifies which users can execute what programs. Can be useful to provide such capabilities to some users for limited activities
    * when running sudo, the user can be set with -u argument flag, providing the username or uid
    * if sudo is executed this way
        - sudo -u#-1 /usr/bin/vi
        Then the command will be executed as root
