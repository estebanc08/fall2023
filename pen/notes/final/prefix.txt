What is the netmask of the network associated with host 128.227.224.196 having 8,190 hosts?

To determine the netmask for a network with a specified number of hosts, you need to find the smallest subnet size that accommodates the required number of hosts. 
In this case, you need a subnet that can support at least 8,190 hosts.The formula to calculate the number of hosts in a subnet is given by 2^(32−subnet prefix length)
Let's find the required subnet size:
        2^(32−subnet prefix length) ≥ 8190
        Solving for the subnet prefix length:
        32-subnet prefix length ≥ log_2(8190)
        32-subnet prefix length ≥ 13
        subnet-prefix length ≤ 19
So the subnet prefix should be 19 bits to accommodate at least 8190 bits
Now, let's construct the netmask. The subnet prefix length of 19 bits means the netmask will have 19 consecutive '1' bits followed by (32 - 19) = 13 consecutive '0' bits. In dotted-decimal notation, 
the netmask is:
    11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000
Converting each octet to decimal:
    255.255.224.0
Therefore, the netmask for the network associated with host IP address 128.227.224.196, having at least 8,190 hosts, is 255.255.224.0.
