What is AWS
    * Amazon Web Service is a cloud application development platform
    * Cloud applications are deployed on servers that could be anywhere in the world. Cam be used to deploy applications

AWS Regions
    * has 25 distinct regions 
    * Two non-geographical regions are US government regions
    * Some services can operate between zones

Simple Storage Service (S3)
    * S3 is easy to use, but that doesn't mean it is really simple to use
    * Object Storage
    * Simple, durable, scalable, low cost, secure
    * Some supported features are:
        - versioning
        - encryption
        - cross region replication
        - storage
        - life cycle management

Permissions in S3
    * S3 is one of the earliest services Amazon provided and it supports control mechanisms that are no longer recommended (ACLs)
    * ACLS:
        - These are deny/allow access controls that can be quite complex
    * Bucket Policies
        - These can be controlled by a per-user or IP basis via radio buttons or crafted as JSON objects that grant specific permissions
    * IAM Policies:
        - These are based on identity. They identify which actions a specific identity can perform on specific resources under specific conditions

S3 Permitted Actions
    * Actions you can take
        - GET   - PUT   - DELETE    - LIST
    * Objects within buckets can also have ACLs
    * Allow permissions on objects can override deny bucket policies

S3 ODRADEK
    * External Penetration Testing Tool
    * Identifies potential S3 bucket vulnerabilities. Although default security settings will protect most buckets, older S3 buckets might have insecure state abound

What is IAM
    * Identity Access Manager: Provides AWS account access control management for everyone except S3

Roles apply to services
    * Policies can't be directly tied to services
    * All IAM policies associated with the role apply to services that have that role
