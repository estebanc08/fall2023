Android Software Structure
    * Linux OS at lowest layer
Android Security Measures
    * Application sandbox uses Linux user protection scheme to isolcate app resources
    * Full system encryption using AES128 and higher is available, but only user data is encrypted
    * Address Space Layout Randomization and no execute-permission on memory areas aer used to avoid stack and heap attacks
    * Permission model controls access to camera, location, telephony
    * All applications must be signed with a cert signed by the app developer 

Android Development Tools
    * System Development Kit (SDK) for Linux, Mac, Windows
    * Emulator for ARM mobile devices
    * Cant send phone calls or real sms except to other instance of emulator

Rooting a mobile access
    * Rooting or jail-braking refers to an escalation of privilege attack in which you increase your privilege attack in
        which  you increase your privilege so you can gain access to all phone resources
    * Rooting is arranged by
        - Exploiting a vulnerability in the underlying software of the device 
        - replacing your entire ROM wit one supporting superuser access

Benefits and drawbacks of rooting
    * Benefits:
        - full control of the device
        - access to the latest software versions
        - can run superuser.apk or other programs that control access to root privileges for other purposes
    * Drawbacks
        - May brick your device
        - voids manufacturer warranty
        - may open your device to a new malware attack

Android App Structure
    * Android applications apk files are just PK files 
    * Contents
        - Manifest: encoded XML file defining software components, services, activities, permissions
        - classes.dex: Dalvik executable code that implements the application
        - Broadcast receivers

Trojan Development
    * Common vector of injection is the Downloading of a Trojan App
        - behave as expected but with malware component
        - Dev Plan
            * Start with legitimate app
            * Disassemble dex code
            * Decode manifest
            * include malicious code
            * Assemble dex code
            * Encode the manifest
            * Signal the final APK

How do these apps get on your device
    * 2018 survey showed
        - 52% no password
        - 57% used for personal email
