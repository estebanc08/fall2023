The OWASP mobile security guide
    * Never use just the owasp model

Key Areas of Mobile App Security
    * Local data storage: use secure key-storage APIs
    * Communication with trusted endpoints: Use secure encrypted channels (TLS)
    * Authentication and authorization
    * Interaction with mobile platform
    * Code quality and exploitation mitigation
    * Anti-Tampering and Anti-Reversing

Testing Methods
    * Transparent application testing versus opaque application testing
    * Static Vulnerability Analysis
        - Manual code review: Method Names, etc. Capable of identifying business-logic errors. Requires expertise
        - Automated Code Analysis: Some tools may work on the compiled app. Others may require source code
    * Dynamic Vulnerability Analysis
        - Verify that the runtime security methods provide protection against prevalent types of attacks
    * Avoid false positives: Automated scanning tools often test the back-end for web browser vulnerabilites

* Mobile application security verification standard
    * MASVS-L1
        - Adheres to mobile appsec best practice. Fulfills basic requirements. Testing process must be in place to verify security controls
    * MASVS-L2
        - Has threat model and security is an integral part of the app architecture and design. Appropriate level for apps that handle sensitive data
    * MASVS-R
        - App is resilient to client-side attacks such as tampering, modding, or reverse engineering to extract sensitive code or data
        - For highly sensitive data such as government data

Architecture design and threat modeling requirements
    * OWASP has a fancy definition of threat modeling
    * Boils down to describing what the threat is, how it can be averted, and how the model can be verified
    * These requirements do not map to test cases
    * Example:
        - All app components are identified and known to be needed
        - Security Controls are never enforced only to the client side
        - Data considered sensitive in the context of the mobile app is clearly identified
