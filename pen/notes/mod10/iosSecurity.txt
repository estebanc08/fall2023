iOS Security
    * At initial release, apple said that no third-party apps would run
    * Developers were told to use web apps instead
    * They eventually allowed third party apps

Security Added
    * Third-party apps run as mobile users
    * Sandboxing restricts apps to limited set of resources
    * Code signature verification was added (apple signing required) both load time and run time
    * Compile-time options for Xcode support ASLR for operating systems and libraries
    * iOS is now one of the most secure consumer-grade operating systems

jailbreaking caveats
    * code signature validation is turned off. Thus unsigned malicious code can be executed
    * Malware that attacks jailbroken iPhones has been found (Key Raider)

Different types of jailbreaks
    * Tethered if it requires your phone to connected to a computer to boot jailbroken
    * Untethered if persistent across reboots
    * Semi-untethered which can boot unjailbroken but can run app to jailbreak

Unc0ver Jailbreak
    * Most recent jailbreak at this time
    * The unc0ver jailbreak applies to all iOS versions from 11-13.5
    * Installation involves either
        - Cydia impactor
        - AltStore

Hacking iDevices of others
    * iOS devices have a small network profile with no services
    * Exploits often aim at client-side vulnerabilities, local network hack
