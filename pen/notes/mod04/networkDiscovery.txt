Network Discovery

What systems can I reach?
    -   Determining what systems can be reached from any given host is an important capability when trying to
    gain control over what hosts in a network
        -   The security of every network is preserved only if every individual device on that network is secure
        -   All intrusion is in th end based on interaction with some kind of host
   
   Identifying hosts with ARP (ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL)
        - ARP is used to translate a devices OSI layer 3 (network) IP address into an OSI layer 2 (datalink) media access control (MAC) address
        - Media Access Control (MAC) address:
            * Unique Six-octet number identifying a specific network attached device
            * Example: 00:50:56:2c:9d:43
            * First 3 bytes identify the vendor and the last three bytes represent the specific device
        - Devices on a physical local (unrouted) network segemtn will respond to ARP requests
        - Thus, to find out all the devices on the local network, one can sweep through all IP address expected to be found on the local network asking for
        their associated MAC addresses. This is known as an arp scan

    Discovering local hosts: ARP-Scan
        -   An executable program arp-scan is used to consult the system table that keeps track of local host IP address to MAC address
            * argument --interface=xxxx tells it to scan using a particular network interface
            * argument --localnet tell its to identify all hosts on the local network to which you are attached

    nmap
        -   Scanning software written by Fyodor (Gordon Lyon)
            * Host discovery
            * Port scanning
            * Version Detection
            * OS detection
            * Scriptable interactions with the nmap scripting engine (NSE)

    Discoverying hosts using ICMP ECHO
        - ICMP echo request (message type 8) will be satisfied (responded to) by many machines. They will respond with an ICMP echo reply (type 0)
        - Ping scans (unlike ARP scans) can reach beyond the unrouted local network across routers (because it uses OSI layer 3 IP packets which are routed)
        - You can use ping to send ICMP echo packets. The ping application parameters vary from system to system. Check local listings 
        - on kali, -c tels how many packets to send "ping -c 1 172.30.0.128"

    Writing bash program to do a ping sweep
        - Shell programming is very useful to pen testing
