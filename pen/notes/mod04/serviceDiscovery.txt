Service Discovery

What are these services?
    - Service one would like to discover provided by programs running on servers (devices running a service)
    - A service will listen for incoming connections on a well-known port
    - When a connection is received, the service will satisfy some application program interface (API) requirements that are most often
    specified by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comment (RFC). RFCs specify how a client and server are to communicate
    - Taking FTP as an example, the ftp protocol is defined by RFCs


 Is there a list of services?
    - List of TCP and UDP port numbers (wikipedia)
    - A mahine can provide any service of any port in range 1-65,535

    - nmap -sS f4rmc0rp.com -p 80:
        * nmap performs a SYN scan and uses a table to tell if the likely service on port 80 and it reports that service associated with port 80
    - nmap -sV f4rmc0rp.com -p 80:
        * nmap performs a version scan, analyzing results of communicating with port 80 to figure out what services its actually running

One Way to do a banner grab
    - Use netcat (program that communicates between stdin, stdout, and the internet) on kali:
        * nc f4rmc0rp.com 80
    - This use of netcat attempts to connect to port 80 of the server f4rmc0rp.com and lets use type input to the service and see its response
    - No banner is immediately printed

How should I use nmap if I dont know how to?
    - A couple of useful scan types are the following
        * -O OS detection scan
        * -A enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute

What are the most common services?
    - Fyodor gives this list:
        * 80 (http)      *  25 (smtp)   *  22 (ssh)         *  53 (domain)      * 554 (rtsp)                
        * 443 (https)    *  21 (ftp)    *  113 (auth)       *  23 (telnet)      * 3389 (MS-Term-Server)

Automated Scanners:
    - Nessus, Nexpose, and OpenVAS are the most common popular commercial network audit tools
    - Often not used as are quite loud, mainly used if stealth not important
    - Your kali VM would normally act as both client and server
