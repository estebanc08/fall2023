More Network Discovery


pings dont always work
    - by default, nmap performs host discovery
    - Sends each of these:
        * ICMP echo request
        * ICMP timestamp
        * TCP SYN to port 443
        * TCP ACK to port 80
    - To disable host discovery and still do a default network scan, we provide the -Pn parameter to nmap

Some other types of scans
    - TCP connect scan (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK) flags -sT
    - TCP SYN scan (half-open Scanning, stealthy) flags: -sY
    - Received:
        * SYN/ACK response from listening host
        * RST/ACK from non-listening port
        * TCP FIN scan (unix hosts send RST for closed ports) flags: -sF
        * TCP Xmas Tree (FIN, URG, PUSH - should get back RST for closed ports) flags: -sX
        * TCP Null scan (should send RST for all closed ports) flags: -sN
        * TCP ACK scan (some firewall rules only allow established connections i.e. those with ACK set) flags: -sA
        * UDP scan (port unreachable response = closed) flags: -sU

Identifying services with nmap
    - by default, nmap scans the 1,000 most popular service ports
    - Identifies one of six different states:
        * Open
        * closed
        * filtered
        * unfiltered
        * open|filtered
        * closed|filtered

    States:
    - Open :
        * a packet with SYN received a SYN|ACK response. Actively accepting TCP connections, UDP datagrams, or SCTP associations
    - Closed:
        * A packet with a SYN received an RST response. Accessible, but no application is listenining on it. May come alive later
    - Filtered:
        * A packet with SYN received no response whatsoever. nmap cannot determing whether open because packets dont seem to reach host
    - Unfiltered:
        * ACK scan shows that packages can get through firewall, but no other response is identified
    - Open|Filtered:
        * Some scan types dont give a response for open ports. In such cases, nmap cannot determine if the port is open or unfiltered
    - Closed|Filtered
        * Similar to open|filtered

NMAP NSE Scripts
    - NSE is the Nmap scripting engine
    - Nmap uses this to interact with services discovered on machines it is scanning
    - Scripts are written using Lua
    - Script categories include
        * Network discovery     * Vulnerability detection
        * Version Detection     * Backdoor Detection

ZMAP
    - zmap is a project of the university of Michigan
    - It is a single-packet scanner that sends packets to IP addresses in an order determined by cyclic multiplicative
    - Generates packedts up to speeds of 1.4 million per second

MASSCAN
    - Uses custom TCP/IP stack to improve network performances. Sends up to 10M packets per second
    - Can use few capabilities of nmap but in same cases can be hard to use because of custom network stack
