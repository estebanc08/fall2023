Least Squares:
    * Foundational problem in statistics
    * Given n points in the plane: (x_1,y_1), (x_2, y_2), ... , (x_n, y_n)
    * Find a line y=ax+b that minimizes the sum of the squared error
        SSE = sum(y_i-ax_i-b)^2

Segmented least squares
    * Points lie roughly on a sequence of serveral line segments
    * Given n points in the plane: (x1, y1), (x2, y2) , â€¦, (xn, yn) with x1 < x2 < ... < xn, find a sequence of lines that minimizes f(x).
    * Goal: Minimize f (x) = E + c L for some constant c > 0, where
		- E = sum of the sums of the squared errors in each segment.
		- L = number of lines

Theorem. [Bellman 1961] DP algorithm solves the segmented least squares problem in O(n^3) time and O(n^2) space
