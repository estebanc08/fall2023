Shortest path with negative weights
        Shortest-path problem: Given a diagraph G = (V,E) with arbitrary edge lengths l_{vw}, find shortest parth from source node s to destination node t

Failed attempts:
    * Dijkstra. May not produce shortest paths when edge lengths are negative.
    * Reweighting. Adding a constant to every edge length does not necessarily make Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm produce shortest paths
