Randomized quicksort
    * Pick a random pivot element p ∈  A
    * 3-way partition the array in L, M and R
    * Recursively sort both L and R

Proof of correctness
    * Proposition. Quicksort sorts any array of n elements.
    * Pf. [ by strong induction on n ]
        ・Base case: n = 1.
        ・Inductive hypothesis: assume true for 1, 2, …, n−1.
        ・3-way partitioning rearranges array around pivot p so that
             - elements smaller than p in left subarray L
             - elements equal to p in middle subarray M
             - elements larger than p in right subarray R
        ・All elements in L must appear before all elements in M, which must appear before all elements in R.
        ・By inductive hypothesis, quicksort sorts both L and R.

Time analysis
    * Proposition: The expected number of compares to quicksort an array of n distinct elements is O(nlogn)
