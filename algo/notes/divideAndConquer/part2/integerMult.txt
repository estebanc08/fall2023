Integer addition and subtraction
    * addition: Given two n-bit integers a and b, compute a+b
    * Subtraction: Given two n-bit integers a and b, compute a-b
    * Grade school algorithms: Phi(n) bit operations

Integer Multiplication
    * Multiplication: Given two n-bit integers a and b, compute a x b
    * Grade school algorithm (long multiplication): Phi(n^2) bit operations

Divide and Conquer multiplication
    * To multiply two n-bit integers x and y:
        - Divide x and y into low and high order bits
        - multiply four 1/2n bit integers, recursively
        - add and shift to obtain result
            * m = ⎡ n / 2 ⎤

            * a = ⎣ x / 2m ⎦ b = x mod 2m

            * c = ⎣ y / 2m ⎦ d = y mod 2m

Karatsuba trick
    * To multiply two n-bit integers x and y:
        - Divide x and y into low- and high-order bits
             bc + ad = ac + bd – (a – b) (c – d)
        - To compute middle term bc + ad, use identity:
        - Multiply only three ½n-bit integers, recursively\
    * proposition: Karatsubas algorithm requires O(n^1.585) bit operations to multiply two n-bit integers
