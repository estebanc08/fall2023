Cycles:
    Def: A path is a sequence of edges which connects a sequence of nodes:
    Def: A cycle is a path with no repeated nodes or edges other than the starting and ending nodes

Cuts:
    Def: A cut is a partition of the nodes into two nonempty subsets S and V – S
    Def: The cutset of a cut S is the set of edges with exactly one endpoint in S

Proposition: A cycle and a cutset intersect in an even number of edges

Spanning Tree:
    Definition: Let H = (V, T) be a subgraph of an undirected graph G = (V, E). H is a spanning tree of G if H is both acyclic and connected
    Proposition: Let H = (V, T) be a subgraph of an undirected graph G = (V, E).
        Then, the following are equivalent:
        ・H is a spanning tree of G.
        ・H is acyclic and connected.
        ・H is connected and has |V| – 1 edges.
        ・H is acyclic and has |V| – 1 edges.
        ・H is minimally connected: removal of any edge disconnects it.
        ・H is maximally acyclic: addition of any edge creates a cycle

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
    ・ Definition: Given a connected, undirected graph G = (V, E) with edge costs ce, 
    a minimum spanning tree (V, T) is a spanning tree of G such that the sum of the edge costs in T is minimized

Fundamental cycle
    Let H = (V, T) be a spanning tree of G = (V, E).
        ・For any non tree-edge e ∈ E : T ∪ { e } contains a unique cycle, say C.
        ・For any edge f ∈ C : (V, T ∪ { e } – { f }) is a spanning tree
    Observation. If ce < cf, then (V, T) is not an MST

Fundamental cutset. Let H = (V, T) be a spanning tree of G = (V, E).
    ・For any tree edge f ∈ T : (V, T – { f }) has two connected components.
    ・Let D denote corresponding cutset.
    ・For any edge e ∈ D : (V, T – { f } ∪ { e }) is a spanning tree
    Observation. If ce < cf, then (V, T) is not an MST

The Greedy Algorithm
    Red rule.
        ・Let C be a cycle with no red edges.
        ・Select an uncolored edge of C of max cost and color it red.
    Blue rule.
        ・Let D be a cutset with no blue edges.
        ・Select an uncolored edge in D of min cost and color it blue.
    Greedy algorithm.
        ・Apply the red and blue rules (nondeterministically!) until all edges are colored. The blue edges form an MST.
        ・Note: can stop once n – 1 edges colored blue

    Proof of correctness:
        Color invariant. There exists an MST (V, T*) containing every blue edge and no red edge.
        Pf. [ by induction on number of iterations ]
        Base case. No edges colored ⇒ every MST satisfies invariant
        * Induction step (blue rule). Suppose color invariant true before blue rule.
            ・let D be chosen cutset, and let f be edge colored blue.
            ・if f ∈ T*, then T* still satisfies invariant.
            ・Otherwise, consider fundamental cycle C by adding f to T*.
            ・let e ∈ C be another edge in D.
            ・e is uncolored and ce ≥ cf since
                - e ∈ T* ⇒ e not red
                - blue rule ⇒ e not blue and ce ≥ cf
            ・Thus, T* ∪ { f } – { e } satisfies invariant
        * Induction step (red rule). Suppose color invariant true before red rule.
            ・let C be chosen cycle, and let e be edge colored red.
            ・if e ∉ T*, then T* still satisfies invariant.
            ・Otherwise, consider fundamental cutset D by deleting e from T*.
            ・let f ∈ D be another edge in C.
            ・f is uncolored and ce ≥ cf since
                - f ∉ T* ⇒ f not blue
                - red rule ⇒ f not red and ce ≥ cf
            ・Thus, T* ∪ { f } – { e } satisfies invariant

    Theorem: The greedy algorithm terminates Blue edges form an MST
    Pf We need to show that either the red or blue rule (or both) applies
        ・Suppose edge e is left uncolored
        ・Blue edges form a forest
        ・Case 1: both endpoints of e are in same blue tree ⇒ apply red rule to cycle formed by adding e to blue forest
        ・Case 2: both endpoints of e are in different blue trees ⇒ apply blue rule to cutset induced by either of two blue trees
