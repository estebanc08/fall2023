Flow Network
    * A flow network is a tuple G=(V,E,s,t,c)
        - Digraph (V,E) with source s ∈ V and sink t ∈  V
        - Capacity c(e) >= 0 for each e ∈ E
    * Intuition: Material flowing through a transportation network material originates at source and is sent to sink

Minimum-Cut problem
    * Def: An st-cut (cut) is a partition (A,B) of the notes with s ∈ A and t ∈  B
    * Def: its capacity is the sum of the capacities of the edges from A to B
        cap(A,B) = summation c(e) 
    * Find a cut of minimum capacity

Maximum-Flow problem
    * Def: An st-flow (flow) f is a function that satisfies:
        - For each e ∈ E        0 <= f(e) <= c(e) [capacity]
        - For each v ∈ V - {s,t}    sum e into v f(e) = sum e out of v f(e) [flow conservation]
    * Def: the value of a flow f is : val(f) = sum e out of s f(e) - sum e into s f(e)
    * Max-Flow Problem: Find the max flow

Relationship between flows and cuts
    * Flow value lemma: Let f be any flow and let (A,B) be any cut. Then, the value of the flow f equals the net flow across the cut (A,B)
        val(f) = sum_{e out of A} f(e) - sum_{e in to A} f(e)

Certificate of optimality
    * Corollary: let f be a flow and let (A,B) be any cut
    * if val(f) = cap(A,B), then f is a max flow and (A,B) is a min cut

Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem
    * Value of a max flow = capacity of a min cut
    * Augmenting path theorem: A flow f is a max flow iff no augmenting paths
