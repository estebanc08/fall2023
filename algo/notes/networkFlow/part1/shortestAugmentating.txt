Shortest Augmenting Path
    Q: How to choose next augmenting path in Ford-Fulkerson
    A: Pick one that uses the fewest edges

Shortest augmenting path: overview of analysis
    * Lemma 1. The length of a shortest augmenting path never decreases.
    	- Pf. Ahead.
    * Lemma 2. After at most m shortest-path augmentations, the length of a shortest augmenting path strictly increases.
    	- Pf. Ahead.
    * Theorem. The shortest-augmenting-path algorithm takes O(m^2 n) time.
    	- Pf.
            ・ O(m) time to find a shortest augmenting path via BFS.
            ・ There are ≤ m n augmentations.
                - at most m augmenting paths of length k
                - at most n−1 different lengths

Level Graph
    * Def: Given a digraph G = (V, E) with source s, its level graph is defined by:
        - ℓ(v) = number of edges in shortest s↝ v path.
        - LG = (V, E_G) is the subgraph of G that contains only those edges (v, w) ∈ E with ℓ(w) = ℓ(v) + 1
        - Key property: P is a shortest s↝ v path in G iff P is an s↝ v path in L_G
