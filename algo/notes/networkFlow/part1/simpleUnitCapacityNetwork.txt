Simple Unit-Capacity Networks
    * Def: A flow network is a simple unit-capacity network if:
        - Every Edge has capacity 1
        - Every node has exactly one entering edge, or exactly one leaving edge, or both
    * Property: Let G be a simple unit-capacity network and let f be a 0-1 flow

Analysis
    * Shortest-augmenting-path algorithm.
        ・ Normal augmentation: length of shortest path does not change.
        ・ Special augmentation: length of shortest path strictly increases.
    * Theorem. [Even–Tarjan 1975] In simple unit-capacity networks, Dinitz’ algorithm computes a maximum flow in O(m n1/2) time.
        - Pf.
            ・ Lemma 1. Each phase of normal augmentations takes O(m) time.
            ・ Lemma 2. After n^{1/2} phases, val( f ) ≥ val(f*) – n^{1/2}
            ・ Lemma 3. After ≤ n^{1/2} additional augmentations, flow is optimal.

    * Lemma 1. A phase of normal augmentations takes O(m) time.
        - Pf:
            ・ O(m) to create level graph LG.
            ・ O(1) per edge (each edge involved in at most one advance, retreat, and
            augmentation).
            ・ O(1) per node (each node deleted at most once)

    * Lemma 2. After n^{1/2} phases, val( f ) ≥ val(f*) – n^{1/2}
        ・ After n^{1/2} phases, length of shortest augmenting path is > n^{1/2}
        ・ Thus, level graph has ≥ n^{1/2} levels (not including levels for s or t).
        ・ Let 1 ≤ h ≤ n^{1/2} be a level with min number of nodes ⇒ ⎢Vh ⎢ ≤ n^{1/2}
        ・ Let A = {v : ℓ(v) < h} ∪ {v : ℓ(v) = h and v has ≤ 1 outgoing residual edge}.
        ・ cap_f (A, B) ≤ ⎢Vh ⎢ ≤ n^{1/2} ⇒ val( f ) ≥ val(f*) – n^{1/2}

    * Lemma 3. After ≤ n^{1/2} additional augmentations, flow is optimal
        - Pf. Each augmentation increases flow value by at least 1
