Matching
    * Def: Given an undirected graph G=(V,E), subset of edges M ⊆ E is a matching if each node appears in at most one edge in M
    * Max Matching: Given a graph G, find the max-cardinality matching

Bipartite Matching
    * Def: A graph G is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two subsets L and R such that every edge connects a node in L with a node in R
    * Bipartite Matching: Given a bipartite graph G = (L U R, E), find a max-cardinality matching

Formulation:
    - Create digraph G′ = (L ∪ R ∪ {s, t}, E′ ).
    - Direct all edges from L to R, and assign infinite (or unit) capacity.
    - Add unit-capacity edges from s to each node in L
	- Add unit-capacity edges from each node in R to t

Proof of correctness
    * Theorem: 1-1 Correspondence between matchings of cardinality k in G and integral flows of value k in G'
    * Pf:
        - Let M be a matching in G of cardinality k
        - Consider flow f that sends 1 unit of each of the k corresponding paths
        - f is a flow of value k

Perfect Matchings in Bipartite Graphs
    * Def: Given a graph G=(V,E), a subset of edges M ⊆ E is a perfect matching if each node appears in exactly one edge in M
    * Structure of Bipartite graphs with perfect matchings
        - Clearly, we must have |L| = |R|
    * Notation: Let S be a subset of nodes, and let N(S) be a set of nodes adjacent to nodes in S
    * Observation: If a bipartite graph G=(L U R, E) has a perfect matching, then |N(s)| >= |S| for all subsets S ⊆ L
    * Pf: Each node in S has to be matched to a different node in N(S)

Halls Marriage Theorem
    * Theorem: Let G=(L U R,E) be a bipartite graph with |L|= |R|. Then graph G has a perfect matching iff |N(S)| >= |S| for all subsets S ⊆ L
    * Pf: Suppose G does not have a perfect matching
        - Formulate as a max-flow problem and let (A, B) be a min cut in G′.
        - By max-flow min-cut theorem, cap(A, B) < |L|.
        - Define L_A = L ∩ A, L_B = L ∩ B, R_A = R ∩ A.
        - cap(A, B) = |L_B |+ |R_A |⇒ |R_A |< |L_A |.
        -  Min cut can’t use ∞ edges ⇒ N(L_A) ⊆ R_A.
        - |N(L_A) |≤ |R_A |< |L_A |
        - Choose S = L_A
