Edge-Disjoint Paths
    * Def: Two paths are edge-disjoint if they have no edge in common
    * Edge-Disjoint paths problem: Given a digraph G=(V,E) and two nodes s and t, find the max number of edge-disjoint s↝ t paths
    * Max-flow formulation. Assign unit capacity to every edge.
    * Theorem. 1–1 correspondence between k edge-disjoint s↝t paths in G and integral flows of value k in G′.
    * Pf: ⇒
        - Let P_1, …, P_k be k edge-disjoint s↝ t paths in G.
        - set f(e) =    {1 edge e participates in some path P_j
                        {0 otherwise
        - Since paths are edge-disjoint, f is a flow of value k

Network Connectivity
    * Def: A set of edges F ⊆ E disconnects t from s if every s↝ t path uses at least one edge in F
    * Network Connectivity: Given a digraph G=(V,E) and two nodes s and t, find min number of edges whose removal disconnects s from t

Menger's Theorem
    * Theorem [Menger]: The max number of edge-disjoint s↝ t paths equals the min number of edges whose removal disconnects t from s
    * Pf: <=
        - suppose the removal of F ⊆ E disconnects t from s, and |F| = k
        - Every s ↝ t path uses at least one edge in F
        - Hence, the number of edge-disjoint paths is <= k
    * Pf: ≥
        - Suppose max number of edge-disjoint s↝ t paths is k.
        - Then value of max flow = k.
        - Max-flow min-cut theorem ⇒ there exists a cut (A, B) of capacity k.
        - Let F be set of edges going from A to B.
        - |F| = k and disconnects t from s

Edge-disjoint paths in undirected graphs
    * Def: Two paths are edge-disjoint if they have no edge in common.
    * Edge-disjoint paths problem in undirected graphs. Given a graph G = (V, E)  and two nodes s and t, find the max number of edge-disjoint s–t path
    * Max-flow formulation. Replace each edge with two antiparallel edges and assign unit capacity to every edge.
    * Observation. Two paths P1 and P2 may be edge-disjoint in the digraph but not edge-disjoint in the undirected graph

    * Theorem. Given an undirected graph and two nodes s and t,
        the max number of edge-disjoint s–t paths equals the min number of edges
        whose removal disconnects s and t.
    * Theorem. Given an undirected graph and two nonadjacent nodes s and t,
        the max number of internally node-disjoint s–t paths equals the min number
        of internal nodes whose removal disconnects s and t.
    * Theorem. Given a directed graph with two nonadjacent nodes s and t,
        the max number of internally node-disjoint s↝ t paths equals the min
        number of internal nodes whose removal disconnects t from s
